** Usage

Put:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(load-module "remember-monitors")
#+END_SRC

In your =~/.stumpwmrc=.

From then on, whenever you plug in and out your external monitor, your
windows will be put where they make the most sense.

For example, if you unplug your external monitor, all the windows will
be put in the remaining screen instead of remaining on the dead
screen. If you plug the monitor back in, the windows will be sent back
to where they were on the external monitor.
